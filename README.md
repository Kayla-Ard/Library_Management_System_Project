# Library Management System Application 

**This application allows the user to create and maintain a library management system. It starts by greeting the user then gives the user a menu to select a choice from on what they would like to do within the application.** _(See welcome message below & picture of the menu for example)_

## _"Welcome to the Library Management System!"_

**The user will choose a number from the menu and from there they will be prompt to answer questions such as information to add or view for a book, user, genre, or author.**

*Here is an example:*
- when the user chooses to add a new book they will be asked for things such as the books isbn, title, publication date, author, or genre.

- Then the user will have the option to do things such as checking a book out, returning a book or viewing/searching for a book.

- The user will be prompt to add their name so they can be assigned a library ID and added to the system. 

**Any time the user gets done entering information in a particular area OR if the user enters invalid information it will take them back to the menu to select a choice. When the user is done using the library management system they can simply select "5" from the main menu and it will thank the user and end the application.**

### Additional Features:
- The application has checks for valid isbn and book publication date.

- The application stores users of the library that can be viewed or searched; a list of any particular user's borrowed books can also be displayed.
